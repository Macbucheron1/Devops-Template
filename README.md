## 2. Apply CI/CD pipeline

### CI

The first CI pipeline we have made is using Github Actions. It is triggered on every push on the main branch. It run the following steps:

1. Check the code
2. Setup Redis
3. Check if Redis is running
4. Setup Node.js
5. Install dependencies
6. Run the tests for the User API

Here is the result of a successful run:

One of the feature of Github Actions is that it can run on multiple OS. Here is the result of a run on Windows:

![CI_UserApi_Windows](./images/CI_CD/FailedWindowsCI.png)

The third job is failing because the Redis server is not available on Windows.
The second one as being stopped because of the error in the third job to economize resources.
